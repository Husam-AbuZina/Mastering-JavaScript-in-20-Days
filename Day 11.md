# Static Typing

### Typescript & Flow

##### Benefits:

1. catch type-related mistakes.
2. Communicate type intent.
3. Provide IDE feedback

##### Caveats:

1. Inferencing is best-guess, not a gurunted.
2. Annotations are optional.
3. Any part of the application that isn’t  typed introduce uncertainty.

## Validating Operand Types

Validation of the subtraction operand:


```jsx
var studentName: string = "Franl";

var studentCount: number = 16 - studentName; // ERROR: can't subtract string
```

## Static Typing Pros
- They make types moee obvious in code.
- Familiarity: they look like other language’s type systems. ( like other languages )
- Extremely popular these days.
- They’re very sophisticated and good at what they do.

  ## Static Typing Cons
- They use “non-JS-standard” syntax .( or code comments )
- They require a build process, which raises the barrier to entry. ( it is just nice to run cod e right away )
- Their sophistication can be intimidating to those without prior formal types experience. ( syntax become so unfamiliar over time and complexity of using them )
- They focus more on “static types” (variables, parameters, returns, properties, etc) than value types. ( they seem to unrespect JS and changing it’s nature! )

## Understanding Your Types
- You simply cannot write quality JS programs without knowing the types involved in your ooperatios.
- Alternately, many choose to adopt a different “static types” systems layered on top while certainly helpful in some respects, this is “avoidance” of a different sort

## STATIC TYPING QUESTIONS:

- Question 1 💡
    
Given the following promisesArray, convert the array into an object using the convertToObj function.

You should apply typescript types to every promise, the input of convertToObj, and the output of convertToObj.

Build interfaces and types as needed.
